#AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
Options +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI

# If you don't want Rails to look in certain directories,
# use the following rewrite rules so that Apache won't rewrite certain requests
# 
# Example:
#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/notrails.*
#   RewriteRule .* - [L]

# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails
# By default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow
# 
# For better performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one
#
# Example:
#   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]
RewriteEngine On
#MTSTART -- Automatically generated, don't modify --
#RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}   !-f
#RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://10.1.130.127:2023/${escape:$1} [P]
#MTEND

# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive,
# then you MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file.
#
# Example:
# Alias /myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public
# RewriteBase /blog
# Check for maintenance file and redirect all requests

#RewriteCond  %{HTTP_COOKIE} _session_id
#RewriteRule  ^$ static/welcome/test.html  [L]
#
#RewriteCond  %{REQUEST_URI} ^/welcome
#RewriteRule  ^.*$ static/welcome/index.html  [L]
#RewriteRule  ^sample/(.*)$ static/sample/$1.html  [L]


RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/system/maintenance.html -f
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !maintenance.html
RewriteRule ^.*$ /system/maintenance.html [L]

RewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]
RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]

# Rewrite to check for Rails cached page
#RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ cache/$1.html [QSA]



# In case Rails experiences terminal errors
# Instead of displaying this message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead
# 
# Example:
#   ErrorDocument 500 /500.html

ErrorDocument 500 /500.html
# "<h1>Oooops...</h1>The application had problems starting up. Don't be alarmed! During our beta phase, this might be quite common. Try to start over to see if you got better luck, and, please report the bug to <a href='mailto:bugs@stixy.com'>bugs@stixy.com</a>."
