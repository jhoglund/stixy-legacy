BleakHouse

A library and Rails plugin for finding memory leaks. 

== License

Copyright 2007 Cloudburst, LLC. See the included LICENSE file. Portions copyright 2006 Eric Hodel and used with permission. See the included LICENSE_BSD file.

== Features

* leak-proof C instrumentation
* logs object counts, real and virtual memory usage, and filled/free heap slots
* easy Rails integration
* automatic generation of nested object charts

== Requirements

* A unix-like operating system.
* Ruby 1.8.6

= Usage

== Installation

First, install the plugin in your Rails app:
  ./script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/fauna/bleak_house/trunk

You need to compile the BleakHouse patched Ruby build. In the plugin directory, run:
  rake ruby:build
  
This gives you a Ruby binary named <tt>ruby-bleak-house</tt> alongside your regular binary.
 
(BleakHouse is also available as a gem: <tt>sudo gem install bleak_house</tt>. If you use the gem, <tt>require 'bleak_house'</tt> in <tt>config/environment.rb</tt>. You will also have to manually install the <tt>bleak_house:analyze</tt> Rake task.)

== Profiling a Rails app

To profile your application (ideally, in production mode, on an actual application server):
  RAILS_ENV=production BLEAK_HOUSE=true ruby-bleak-house ./script/server 

Browse around manually, thrash your entire app with a script, target troublesome controllers/actions, etc.

Then, to analyze:
  RAILS_ENV=production rake bleak_house:analyze

And then look in <tt>log/bleak_house/</tt>.

= Extras

== Options

You also can set the SMOOTHNESS environment variable if you want. The SMOOTHNESS setting just averages frames together. This is not a rolling average: 10 frames become 5 at <tt>SMOOTHNESS=2</tt>. 

== Using BleakHouse outside of Rails

If you want finer snapshots than every action, or want to use the plugin outside of Rails, see the BleakHouse::CLogger class.

== Troubleshooting

If you see the error <tt>Symbol not found: _rb_gc_heaps_used</tt>, it means you installed the patched binary, but tried to profile the server with the regular binary.

You may get library require errors if you install <tt>ruby-bleak-house</tt> 1.8.6 alongside a different verson of Ruby. You could try to patch your local version of Ruby instead, or you could just upgrade to 1.8.6, which has a good trackrecord of stability.
