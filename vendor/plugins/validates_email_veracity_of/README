Type:: Rails Validation Plugin

Validates an email address for well-formedness and verifies it's domain by checking if it has
any MX or A records.


=== Options

* *message*
  - Changes the default error message.
* *domain_check*
  - Mail exchange and address record lookup are skipped if false.
* *mx_only*
  - When set, only mail exchange servers (MX) are looked up and the address server (A)
    lookup is skipped.
* *timeout*
  - Time (in seconds) before the domain lookup is skipped. Default is 2.
* *fail_on_timeout*
  - Causes validation to fail if a timeout occurs.
* *timeout_message*
  - Changes the default timeout error message.


=== Examples

* <tt>validates_email_veracity_of :email, :message => 'is not correct.'</tt>
  - Changes the default error message from 'is invalid.' to 'is not correct.'
* <tt>validates_email_veracity_of :email, :domain_check => false</tt>
  - Mail exchange and address record lookups are skipped.
* <tt>validates_email_veracity_of :email, :mx_only => true</tt>
  - Address record lookup is skipped but the domain is still checked for mail exchange servers.
* <tt>validates_email_veracity_of :email, :timeout => 0.5</tt>
  - Causes the domain lookup to timeout if it does not complete within half a second.
* <tt>validates_email_veracity_of :email, :fail_on_timeout => true, :timeout_message => 'is invalid.'</tt>
  - Causes the validation to fail on timeout and changes the error message to 'is invalid.'
    to obfuscate it.
